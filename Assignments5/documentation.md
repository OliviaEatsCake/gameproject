For my character and design choices, I was going for a nature themed design.
I wanted it to look like something you would see in the woods of northern Alberta.
My character was based off of a halloween costume I made, and this really awesome cloak I have. 
To create my designs I used Pixel Art, it's the website I am most comfortable with, and is really easy to use
I also used a Wacom board just to make things easier for myself. 
Importing the assets to unity was pretty easy, I created a folder for all of my designs and Imported them to unity one by one. 
 I like making my designs very complicated and detailed, so that caused many challenges with the background. 
 Put together everything looked way too busy and I ended up remaking my background multiple times until it looked correct.
 It also took a while to get unity to work correctly, because the first couple of game templates were incorrect, or didnâ€™t work properly.
